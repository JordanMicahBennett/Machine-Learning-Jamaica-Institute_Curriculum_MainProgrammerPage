# Main Overview
Based on the goals that [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) desginates its students to perform, programmers may select from 4 different tiers of of curriculums.

As such, from here on out, you select one of the tiers below, and begin your learning process:

1. [MLJI For Programmers that know python, and know github (Tier A)](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Machine-Learning-Jamaica-Institute_Curriculum-Type-B_Programmers_TierA/blob/master/README.md)
2. [MLJI For Programmers that know python, but don't know github (Tier B)](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Machine-Learning-Jamaica-Institute_Curriculum-Type-B_Programmers_TierB/blob/master/README.md)
3. [MLJI For Programmers that don't know python, but know github (Tier C)](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Machine-Learning-Jamaica-Institute_Curriculum-Type-B_Programmers_TierC/blob/master/README.md)
4. [MLJI For Programmers that don't know python, and don't know github (Tier D)](https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/Machine-Learning-Jamaica-Institute_Curriculum-Type-B_Programmers_TierD/blob/master/README.md)

Each of the above may vary based on the candidate's awareness of python and github, which are designated by [MLJI](http://mlj-institute.appspot.com/) as crucial components in the resulting career seeking endeavour at the curriculum's completion. The candidate may select other source code hosting platforms such as bitbucket, if he/she desires it, but the lessons are typically github-centered.
